 abstract        = {Sea-level rise has been the major driver of coastal evolution since the end of the last glaciation. The reconstruction of the sea-level evolution is relevant to gauge how climatic forcing may influence the rates of future sea-level change as well as to understand the complex interplay between coastal landscape changes and human occupation since the prehistoric period. The Mediterranean region has been a major focus for sea-level studies since the 60s. These studies analysed a wide range of proxies which allowed to robustly define the variability of the Mediterranean sea-level evolution over the last millennia. These studies often coupled geological investigation with archeological data that were used to tune geophysical models of sea-level changes. This resulted in an improved picture of the climatic and anthropic drivers of sea-level changes and coastal evolution in the different regions of the Mediterranean Sea.},
 abstractchatgpt = {The presentation discusses the millennial evolution of Mediterranean sea levels, emphasizing the interplay between geological, archaeological, and climatic factors. It highlights the significant sea level rise of 120-130 meters since the last glacial maximum 21,000 years ago, followed by stabilization during the Holocene. The Anthropocene era marks deviations from natural cycles due to human impact. Sea level changes are attributed to eustatic, isostatic, and tectonic factors, with localized influences such as sediment compaction and crustal movement. Research methodologies include sediment coring and geoarchaeology, with findings showing stable sea levels over the last 4,000 years. Future predictions must integrate complex variables like geomorphology and climatic effects.},
