Okay, I think we'll make a start now. So thank you everybody for for coming and joining us for this new 2025 talk of our Human Paleosystems in Focus seminar series, which takes you on quite an expansive tour of different places and time periods. Today we'll be looking at millennial evolution of the Mediterranean sea level with Matteo Vacchi, who will be introduced by Margherita today. Over to you, Margherita. 

[Margherita Colucci]
Thank you and welcome again everyone online and thank you Professor Matteo Vacchi for joining us today. So I will briefly introduce the speaker. So Professor Vacchi is a coastal geomorphologist. He obtained his PhD in Earth Sciences at the University of Genova in Italy, then completed his postdoctoral research in France, the University of Aix Marseille and Montpellier, and he moved to the UK as a lecturer to the School of Life Science and Environmental Sciences at the University of Exeter. He has also been the coordinator of young researchers in the Ocean Sciences Division of the European Geophysical Union and currently the Vice President of the Coastal and Marine Process Commission at the INQA, the International Union for Quaternary Research. So since 2019 he's a professor at the Department of the Earth Sciences at the University of Pisa in Italy. And in the coastal geomorphology, his main fields of interest are paleoenvironmental reconstructions and the millennial response of coastal environments to the climate modification. So this also led him to geo-archaeology, where he investigated the past trajectories of coastal environments and their impacts on the historical and prehistorical coastal communities. In the last years he was involved in several research activities along the Atlantic, Africa, Asian and Caribbean coasts, considering the various impacts of global warming. However, his major geographical focus has always been the Mediterranean area, where he was in charge of research projects developed in collaboration with universities in France, Morocco, Greece and Spain. So today we will hear more from this side of his research, focusing on the millennial evolution of the Mediterranean sea level. So over to you, Matteo. 

[Matteo Vacchi]
Hey, thank you so much for this invitation. It's a great pleasure for me. And I hope that my presentation will cover thematics that maybe are not very, very, very familiar to you, but I think they have a very interesting implication in a large variety of topics. So first of all, I will start with this image, with this picture of this aerial photo of the ancient town of Nora. We are in the south of Sardinia, and this is one of the last projects I had in the recent year. And this is a clear example of how we can say put together archaeology. You see the archaeological town is a Punic Roman town, very important in the south of Sardinia. And of course, the mud, the mud that is full, full of mud, the lagoon that is behind the town. Of course, I cannot show the geophysical modelling because of course, the quality of the picture of the physical model is not as beautiful as this aerial photo. But anyway, what I'd like to show you today is that we can really approach the problem of the millennial evolution of the Mediterranean, and not just the Mediterranean sea level from a wide range of thematics. So that will cover geology, archaeology and geophysics. So first of all, we are talking about sea level. So this is a very important problem now. So you can see everywhere for the general public, all the problems related with the rising sea level and whatever. And of course, the environmental problem is just a small part of the problem because the sea level rise is for sure a political, social, and demographic and economic problem. And of course, at different scale, this was also something similar in the past, especially in the recent past, but also at historical and maybe prehistorical scale. The key question related to the changes in the sea level are essentially two. How much, so what will be the sea level in the future in the next 50 years and in the next 100 years. And the other main problem is how fast will rise the sea level. Of course, this is a problem of forecast, which is based on paleo data. And today I'm going to show you how we can produce the paleo data from a wide range of proxies. The main problem is that during the Holocene, especially, sorry, during the Quaternary, the Earth was in a sort of continuous equilibrium between glacial and interglacial cycles. And this continued up to the entire Holocene. And when we entered in what was called the Anthropocene, the Earth is deviating from this equilibrium. And the main problem is that it's not going to come back in this sort of natural oscillation. The sea level cycles in this video, I hope you can see the video starting, were a typical cycle of the Quaternary. And as you can see, there were several variations in the extent of the ice, the global ice sheet. And you can see that there were some steps that are very important in these cycles. For instance, at this period, that is about 125 kilo years ago, what is called the Tyrrhenian period in the Mediterranean, or what is called the last interglacial, the situation was very similar of the ice caps, was very similar to the present day. But the big difference was the presence of the humans, of the modern humans and in the not the prehistoric humans, but I mean, the industrial humans, let's say, sorry for these horrible terms. But this last interglacial is used as a sort of non-industrial analog for the future. After this, we have especially another important, very important step, that is this one, this is the last glacial maximum that ended about 21,000 years ago. And as you can see, there were very important ice covers in the Northern Hemisphere, and also in the South and in Antarctica. As you can see, the Antarctica ice sheet is not changing a lot in terms of size, in terms of expansion, because there is no land to expand. But of course, also the Antarctic is changed a lot in terms of thickness. Comprising the Northern Hemisphere, we had a huge amount of ice that after the last glacial maximum started melting and this induced a very important sea level rise in the last 20,000 years. In the last 20,000 years, that at global scale was about 120-130 meters with respect to the present mean sea level. So essentially, the sea level cycles have local impact that are the results of global modification. So we are very interested in understanding how the sea level responded to this major climatic change. And it's very important to analyze this period. So the period after the last glacial maximum, as I said, the temperature were very different from today, colder then there was the stabilization during the Holocene period. And what is important now is to understand what happened in the pre-industrial period. So everything that was before the industrial revolution, in order to understand what was caused by natural cycles and what was caused by the human impact. Of course, the sea level is a very complex, let's say, term because the sea level is changing a lot also every day. So we have the tides that are changing every day in several parts of the world. Then we have other short-term changes in the sea level. So for instance, the different of pressures that are related with the storm surges or something similar. Then we have the short-term sea level changes related to the change in the surface temperature of the ocean. And of course, we have also changes in the surface of the sea that are related to the ocean, the global ocean currents. But all these are not very interesting for us. What is very important for us is to describe the relative sea level change in a given reason. So in this part of the coast, we need to reconstruct which factors are acting to modify the sea level. Of course, when I talk about the relative sea level, it means that it's a composite term because there are global changes like the eustatic change that is essentially the melting, the main melting of the global ice caps. This is a global factor that controls the sea level change. But of course, there are also some very local factors that can affect the relative sea level in a given portion of the coast. For instance, the crust is not a sort of monolithic block, but the crust can move. So also the soil can move for tectonic movement. Or also there is the sediment compaction that induce some subsidence. So there is a lowering of the soil related to the compaction of the sediments. And of course, there are other components that can be very important. A major component that is very important is the isostatic component. What is the isostasy? Essentially, the crust was covered by a big amount of ice. And so because the crust is floating on the mantle that is not liquid, but is viscous, the crust went down during the ice age. And then when the ice sheet melted, this part of the crust experienced an uplift. And conversely, the redistribution of the water in the global ocean induced a sort of subsidence of small subsidence of the area that are now very far from the global ice sheet. So this is a component that is very important. And this is just to say that it is very complex to define a global sea level rise. But the sea level is rising or is falling, because in some areas the sea level now is falling at very different rates, depending on a large amount of factors. For instance, in the UK, you have all this area in green that was below the ice sheet during the last glacial maximum that now is rising for isostatic component. So essentially, the relative sea level here is falling because the crust is rising. In this area that was really at the border, there is a sort of equilibrium between the isostatic component and the eustatic component. Conversely, in this area that was at the periphery of the paleo ice sheet, the sea level is rising a lot, because the crust is sinking. How we measure the sea level? We measure the sea level with a wide range of tools. Of course, we can use a lot of modern tools such as the satellites, such as the radar altimetry, or the tidal gauges. And these are very interesting, because actually we have tidal gauges that are quite old. So they date back to the beginning of the last century or so. And so this is the cover, the coverage now of the tidal gauges all around the world. There are some tidal gauges that are very, very old, as I said. For instance, the Battery of New York dates back to the end of the 19th century. And in this case, this is the graph from the NOAA website, the sea level is rising at 2.834 plus or minus 0.09 millimeters per year. This is what it's saying, these tidal gauges. If we go in Alaska, this is another tidal gauge that is quite interesting. As you can see, the sea level here is, the relative sea level is falling, is slightly falling, because we are in a totally different isostatic context. So in this case, the eustatic component, so the sea level, the equivalent sea level from the melting of the ice caps, is compensated by the isostatic rebound. And also, if we go further north, this is another area in Alaska, the sea level, it's even falling more. And this is because we have more isostatic component in this area. So, just to show you that it's very complex to define a general sea level curve at global scale. In some areas, for instance, this is the Jakarta, it's one of the most complex towns of the world, the subsidence was very, very important in the last 40 years. And we have areas where the sediment compaction and also the water extraction from the storage caused more than four meters of subsidence. So this resulted in a very, very important sea level rise in this area. But if we clean a bit all these factors, and we only consider the sea level from the eustatic point of view, so just related to melting of the ice sheet, we see that in the recent years, so essentially in the last 2000 years, we have a sort of stable sea level that accelerated just in the recent period. But this is just to introduce, but what I'd like to stress a lot during this presentation is how we measure the sea level before the the industrial area, because we need to have a sort of, we need a long series of data in order to compare the industrial period... [missing audio] The GPS are just from, the records are just from the industrial period. So we need to go back in the past. And so we need paleo sea level indicators that can be derived from biological, geological or archaeological features that has a measurable connection with the paleo sea level. And this is a bit the focus of my research. So as I said, since the last glacial maximum that ended more or less here, we have a sort of very rapid sea level rise up to about 8000-7000 years ago. And then we have a very important stabilization. Why we have this stabilization? Because here we had a sort of very important deceleration in the melting of the northern hemisphere ice sheet, especially the Canadian ice sheet, which is called the Laurentide ice sheet, that practically stopped melting at the rates that occurred from 20 to about 8000 years ago. And so we had a sort of very important stabilization. So since that period, the sea level is relatively stable, but we will see that there are some points that are not fully explained yet. In the recent years, there was a big effort at global scale founded by different projects in order to produce a sort of standardized way to produce the paleo sea level. And as you can see, we have covered together with other colleagues a large portion of the global coastline. I have worked a lot in the Mediterranean, of course. I have a paper now that is almost published on the Atlantic coast of Africa. So I'm very happy of this because we have filled a very important empty space in the global repository of paleo sea level. And as you can see, this is the plot of all the sea level derived from this map. And you can see that the sea levels are, the sea level evolution is very different. There are areas where the sea level rose of about 50 meters in the last 10,000 years. And there are other places where the sea level dropped of about 200 meters in the last 7,000 years. Why? Because of course, there is a wide difference, especially in the isostatic component. So the response of the solid earth to the loading and unloading of the ice caps and of the melted water in the ocean. So, I'm sorry, this slide is in Italian, but don't worry. I'm just saying that we use a wide range of proxies to reconstruct the sea level. Today, I'm going to talk about especially the cores in the transitional environment. I don't have time to speak about the geomorphological indicators of sea level that I can find underwater. But anyway, there is a wide range of proxies that we can use for this kind of investigation. So, as I said, we use, we try to produce sea level indicators in low energy setting. Why the low energy setting? Because salt marshes or mangrove environments or coastal lagoons, they are in equilibrium with the open sea. But of course, they are much less energetic in terms of deposition of sediments and whatever. And so they are much more conservative and they can help us in reconstruct the sea level with a very important resolution. So, a sea level indicator is a biological or chemical feature, which has a systematic and quantifiable relationship with the tidal frame. Of course, we study mud, essentially, and we study what is inside the mud. So, the micro and macrofossils, the plant macro and microfossil, and of course, the lithostratigraphic change. For instance, here you can see a very interesting scheme. There is a very clear change in the vegetation of this salt marsh. We have the Spartina alternifolora, which is much more tolerant of the salt and which is more inside the tidal frame. So, it's subjected to the inundation during the tidal cycle. Then there is the Spartina patens that is less tolerant to the tidal inundation. So, if we find this kind of macrofossil within the sediments, of course, the sea level will be a bit lower than the elevation of this layer. Then we have the Phragmitus and the Quercus and Pinus rigida, which are not tolerant to the sea. So, for sure, the paleo sea level will be much lower than the elevation of the layer with this macrofossils. So, this is based on transfer function on the modern analog. It is an approach that started in the 60s or in the 70s, especially thanks to the Dutch geologists that were always among the best for sea level studies for obvious reasons. Then it was also developed a lot in the UK. So, I have worked a lot in the Mediterranean salt marshes, which are a bit weird in terms of salt marshes because, of course, in the Mediterranean we don't have a lot of tidal excursion. Typically, we have about 30 to 40 centimeters. But in the recent years, we have found quite interesting biozonation along the Mediterranean salt marsh. So, this data were very interesting for sea level reconstruction at a resolution that was very, very good. This, for instance, is a salt marsh in the south of Corsica. We are near Ajaccio. But anyway, we core these marshes with vibro cores, but we prefer to use also the end cores, corers, sorry, because we prefer to keep as much undisturbed as possible the sediments. We have worked also in the tropical mangroves, of course, not in the Mediterranean, but these mangroves are very interesting because also in this case, they are in equilibrium with the open sea, but they are very conservative in terms of sediments. This is a video of my students. We were coring in the north of Africa, and this is very interesting. And this is how we core sediments in an intertidal environment. Here we were in low tide. We used a Russian corer, but we use also a lot of other types of corers. So, what we do after, so after the extraction of the cores, of course, we study the biostratigraphy, the micro and the macrofossils, and if possible, the pollens in order to reconstruct the phases of deposition. And of course, we try to define if the layer was deposited in a freshwater, brackish or marine environment. And the other very important point is to date this layer in order to have the age of the paleo sea level. So, from the cores, essentially, we can produce data which are from brackish environment, from salt marshes, from open lagoon or marine-influenced lagoon or from marine sands. Each of these indicators will have a different degree of accuracy in indicating the paleo sea level, or in some cases, it will be just an upper constraint or a lower constraint of the paleo sea level. For instance, if we find a marine sand, of course, the marine sand can be deposited one meter, two meters, three meters below the mean sea level, so it's not indicating a lot with a nice accuracy the paleo sea level, and we use it just to say that the sea level at this particular time period was above a certain datum. The same, we can do it in other environments like the mangroves and wherever. So, once we have a suite of these indicators, we can reconstruct the sea level evolution that I'll show you in a while. So, this is essentially how we produce the sea level from the cores. But, of course, as I said, in the Mediterranean, I also use a lot the geoarchaeology to produce the sea level. For instance, this is a very interesting shipyard that was studied by several authors. This photo is from Christophe Morhange, which is a nice colleague from Aixx-Marseilles University. And, of course, this is a shipyard, so this archaeological structure is strongly related to a paleo sea level, because, of course, the functioning of this structure was linked to a paleo sea level position. Here we are in Greece, but if we turn the view, as you can see, we are very far from the sea right now, because I will show you in a while that there was a vast progradation of this coastal plain. But this is a perfect proxy to reconstruct the sea level, because this harbor area was progressively silted by the progradation of the coastal plain, and so the sediments isolated this coastal structure. And in several cases, we have also the marine encrustation that we can find on the top of this coastal structure that were sealed by the amount of sediments. So, using this data, we can produce, especially in the Mediterranean, paleo sea levels that are very accurate. And now I'm going to show you some examples of this. This is the progradation of this big Acheloos delta that progressively silted the whole area. So, in the Mediterranean, this was more or less the conformation of the shoreline during the last glacial maximum. As you can see, there were some areas that were very different from today. Of course, this is just a bad hub approach, so of course we cannot reconstruct with a big accuracy the shape of the shoreline during the last glacial maximum. This is based on the present day topography, so essentially we removed 120 meters from the present day topography, but there were areas that were quite different from today. For instance, the Adriatic was half of today, of the today's shape. There were some very interesting macro islands, like Corsica and Sardinia, that were composing huge macro islands, but that were not connected to the continents. And as you can see also, Sicily was much larger and was including also the Maltese archipelago. Another major change is in Tunisia, because the Ghabes Gulf, especially the Gabes Gulf, is a very shallow basin. And so, of course, the shoreline between Africa and Europe during the last glacial maximum was much smaller than today. There are some very important prehistoric evidences of this change of the sea level after the last glacial maximum. For sure, one of the most iconic examples of sea level change during the prehistoric period is represented by the Cosquer cave. We are in southern France, not far from Marseille, and this guy, Cosquer, was a fisherman, I think, and that discovered this cave, and the entrance of this cave is now at minus 37 meters. He explored this long siphon and he arrived in this large chamber that was full of paintings. So, for sure, the entrance of this cave was free of water during the period of frequentation of this cave. However, the presentation of the period of frequentation of this cave was broadly during the last glacial maximum, a bit earlier and up to the end of the last glacial maximum. So, probably, this cave was very, very far from the paleo shoreline. So, you can see here this reconstruction and probably the sea level was about 120 meters far away from the entrance, or about 100 meters far away from the entrance of this cave. But anyway, this discovery of the Cosquer cave was a very impressive evidence of how much the sea level changed in a relatively small time period. And after the 60s, there was a big effort from a wide range of researchers that started to investigate the sea level evolution according to the archaeological evidence that are now semi-submerged. So, you can see some of the old publications that focused a lot on archaeological structures that were strongly connected with the sea, with the coast. So, ancient harbour and we will see also some fish tanks, so, structures that were used for the fish farming. But first of all, I'd like to show you another very important source of sea level data of the last 2,500 years, which was the discovery of the ancient harbour of Marseille. These are quite old photos. Also, these photos were provided to me by Christophe Morhange. And also in this case, the port was progressively silted by the progradation of this area that is not so far from the modern harbour, which is here. And this is the area that was excavated for the ancient harbour of Marseille. And it is very interesting because the structures were still covered by biological incrustation. So, for instance, they found the upper limit of the barnacles in poles, in other areas like quay or, you know, moors and whatever. So, the ancient harbour of Marseille was one of the most important geoarchaeological examples of sea level reconstruction. And according to the dating of the coastal structure and also of the old sediments, they were able to reconstruct about, with a certain, with a very important accuracy, the last 3,000 years of the sea level evolution in this sector of southern France. You can see here some of the wooden structures of the port, which were covered by the barnacles. And Christophe Morhange and Paolo Pirazzoli that studied this airbus, this port, sorry, this airbus, they made analogues with the present distribution of these barnacles in the modern harbour of Marseille, which is not far away, it's about 200 meters far away from the ancient harbour. And so, according to this modern analogue, they were able to reconstruct the sea level with a very important precision. I show you another example. This is a place where I have worked, is the ancient harbour of Naples. So, for the excavation for the new metro station of Piazza Municipio in Naples, they discovered a huge amount of archaeological remains. So, they found the Hellenistic harbour and also the Roman harbour. You can see here very beautifully the dredging traces on the bases of the Hellenistic harbour that were made in order to dredge the sea bottom for the transportation of the boats, also with some shipwrecks. And here, there are the shipwrecks of the Roman period that were found above this layer. And fortunately, in this area, we found very important sea level data that also in this case, because also this port was silted, fortunately, were derived from archaeological structures that preserved also encrustations of fossil animals like Ostrea or balanids or vermetids or whatever. So, for instance, here, this is a Hellenistic ramp that probably was used to store the boat. But anyway, on the top of this structure, there was a very continuous layer of Ostrea that was used to precisely reconstruct the sea level. Also, the Roman quay, this very beautiful Roman quay that showed a very continuous upper limit of this Ostrea encrustation and also the vermetid encrustation. Also, in this case, we have done a sort of analogue with the present distribution of these species, and this allowed us to reconstruct the sea level evolution. In this area, we were also lucky because we found very beautiful sedimentological layers well preserved. For instance, this blue area is the marine layer. So, when the port, when the harbour was in use, so this is a marine layer full of harbour garbage, we have also inside the layer with the Pompeii eruption. So, at this period, from the foundation of the harbour during the Augustan age up to the second half of the 4th century AD, the harbour was in operation because we have a marine layer and after this we have the progressive silting of the harbour with the position of lagonal sediments and at the end with alluvial sediments. We were also able to reconstruct, firstly, we reconstruct the sea level evolution. As you can see, these are our proxies of sea level, the red square derived from the dating of the biological structure that were on the top of the archaeological structure. And as you can see here, the sea level evolution is not continuous, we have rapid rise, then stabilisation, then another continuous rise. This is because the area of Naples is volcano-tectonically active and so the relative sea level is much more controlled by tectonic and volcano-tectonic factors than by other factors like the isostasy of the eustasy or whatever. This is some evidence of sea level change from tectonically stable area in the Mediterranean and as you can see, the sea level evolution in Naples is very different. This allowed also to reconstruct the water column in the harbour that was very interesting for the archaeologists in order to reconstruct the typology of frequentation of this harbour and also comparing this with the shipwrecks that they found inside the harbour. Then we have the fish tanks that, as I said, is another very important structure that was used to reconstruct the paleo-sea level, especially in the central Tyrrhenian Sea. These fish tanks were structures for fish farming that were typical in front of villas, maritime villas, from Tuscany down to the Campania region. We found this in southern Tuscany, in the whole Lazio region near Rome and also in several sites in Campania and in the Napoli regions. Of course, these structures were strictly connected with the sea because they needed to exchange the water, a very frequent exchange of the water in order to keep the water safe inside the fish tanks. This is the most beautiful one that is in Punta della Vipera, it's north of Rome, it's free of access, it's a very beautiful area, so if you have time I suggest you to go. But in the last years there was a big debate related to the sea level associated to the fish tanks and especially since this very important scientist started studying these fish tanks. This guy is Kurt Lambeck, which is one of the most important geophysicists of the world that wanted to tune the geophysical modelling for the Mediterranean, so the geophysical modelling of sea level, using the archaeological data. Of course, the approximation of the fish tanks, so the vertical error of the fish tanks to reconstruct the sea level, was very accurate because of the microtidal nature of the Mediterranean and also because the preservation of this structure was very good. So there are some structures of these fish tanks which are now semi-submerged. We have the wall that was built to protect the fish tanks, the internal part of the fish tanks from the main swells. Then we have the crepidines, which are the sort of benches that were on the all around the structure and that were used to walk all around the fish tanks and feed the fishes. And inside we have the protected basin. Of course, there is why I say there is a debate, because the main debate is related to the functional elevation of this crepidines. So one school is saying that both crepidines, so also the lowest one and also the uppest one, they were totally outside the water. So the other school of geoarchaeologists is saying that just this crepidines, so the upper one, was exposed and so it was outside the water. The other one was semi-submerged. So of course there is a big debate that is not solved anymore and that is changing the sea level of about 30-40 cm. That seems nothing, but of course in the last 2000 years the sea level variation in the Mediterranean was between 1.2 and 0.7 according to the different schools of scientists. And of course this big change is fundamental to tune or not tune some geophysical model, which I'm going to show you in a while. So this is, in order to put all the data together, this is a plot of all the archaeological and geological data which we have now for the Mediterranean Sea. As you can see there isn't a big ... I mean the data are quite clear. So we have about 50 meters, 45 meters of relative sea level rise in the last 12 000 years and we have the sea level that rose quite rapidly up to 8 000 years ago and this is the global signal. And then in the last 4 000 years we have a very very important stabilization of the sea. The sea level of the Mediterranean in the last 4 000 years at global Mediterranean, especially western Mediterranean scale, was very very stable. Okay, this is very important and as you can see in this plot the data are coming from practically everywhere in the western Mediterranean. Unfortunately we have a big gap in the northern African Mediterranean region and this is due of two factors. First of all it's very complex to have the permission to go and core in the coastal lagoons of northern Africa. We have now some more data for Morocco but for instance for Algeria it's very complex. And also the quality of the data, unfortunately in the test we had, is not as good as we had for the northern side of the Mediterranean. When I say not as good it means that the amount of foraminifera or whatever on the modern lagoon is not as abundant as we have in other regions of the Mediterranean. So this is the picture of the sea level in the Mediterranean in the last 12 000 years. Here we have replied to the first big question how much the sea level rose in the last 12 000 years. As I said it rose of about 45-50 meters in the last 12 000 years. Then in the last 8 000 years the relative sea level rise was less than 10 meters and really in the last 4 000 years the total relative sea level rise did not exceed 2 meters. So it was very very stable. Of course there are several other parameters that change the morphology of the coastline especially the progradation of the main river and whatever. But the sea level remained very stable. This is another important output of my recent research, how fast it rose and as you can see these are the rates of sea level change. These are a sort of global Mediterranean sea level rising rates. There were periods between 10 000 and 8 000 years ago where the sea level rose up to 9 millimeters per year. But as I said in the last 4 000 years the sea level was very very stable and the relative sea level rise was always less than 0.5 millimeters per year. Apart from the last 120 years where we have the rapid acceleration of the sea level which is related to the to the anthropogenic components or related with the industrial period. Of course here you can see that there are some fluctuations in the sea level rising rates. Another point that was very important is trying to understand why we had this small oscillation that changed the sea level rising rates in the last 4 000 years. I'll show you in the last slide. These are how the sea level rose. The rates of sea level in the different periods in different parts of the Mediterranean. So they are the maps which show the differences between different parts of the western Mediterranean basin. As you can see in the early Holocene the sea level was rising much rapidly in the western basin than in the eastern basin. Then in the transition between the mid-Holocene and the late-Holocene we have a sort of inversion. So we have a big stabilization of the easternmost basin with rates that didn't exceed the 0.2 millimeters per year. Conversely the data in the late-Holocene for the Ionian basin were the highest of the western Mediterranean basin. So we are trying now to understand why. This is not fully explained. It's probably something related with some climatic components. Another very important point is that we have found some significant correlation between the rates of the Mediterranean sea level and the sea surface temperature of the Mediterranean. We have shown that for instance during the late antique Little Ice Age, so after the Roman period, we have a colder climate that resulted in a deceleration of the sea level rising rates at Mediterranean scale. Then during the Mediterranean climate anomaly there was a warmer period and also the sea level started again rising more than before. Conversely we didn't find any clear correspondence between the Little Ice Age and the rate of rise of the sea level in the Mediterranean. This is very interesting because firstly we demonstrated that the sea level of the Mediterranean is also controlled by the sea surface temperature changes of the Mediterranean. This is a steric component that is related to the expansion of the sea related to the warming. It's what we call the steric component. Because the Mediterranean region is warming 20% faster than the global average, of course for the prediction of the future sea level rising in the Mediterranean we should consider also this steric effect that can exacerbate the future sea level rise at the Mediterranean scale. Then I'm going to finish with the submersion risk. Of course we can reconstruct the sea level flooding in the future using several kinds of approach, but in the past higher sea level was not always synonym of coastal inundation. For instance here this is the Agios Georgios area in western Naxos. You can see we have a series of paleo shorelines underwater. These are called beach rocks. Practically they indicate the position of the paleo shorelines. They are very beautiful geomorphological evidence of the paleo shoreline position. As you can see the sea level was rising during this period. The oldest shoreline is of about 4 000 years ago and the youngest one is about 1.4 thousand years ago. During that period there was a continuous step back of the shoreline. At a certain moment the morphology changed a lot and we have the formation of this big bay. This is just to show you that the coast is not a bad hub. It's complex to predict the evolution of the shoreline with an higher sea level because from a geomorphological point of view there are several other components that can modify the shoreline geometry. This back-up approach for the future sea level scenarios are very simplistic. For instance in several coastal plains of the Mediterranean, here we are in Corsica, here we are in Sardinia, despite the sea level was rising with more than one millimeter per year, the shoreline was not back-stepping but it was prograding. It's not just a matter of sea level rise but we need to consider a lot of other components such as the sediment transport, the variation of the coastal geometry in order to predict the sea level evolution in the future. This is why it's very important to core in order to reconstruct the paleomorphology of the coast because if we can reconstruct how the coast responded to periods of higher sea level rise, we can maybe tune the future models which are very important to understand what will be the future geometry of the coast in the context of the climate change. I have finished, I don't know if I was on time, I didn't have my watch but anyway, thank you so much for your attention and I'm ready for your questions. 

[Eleanor Scerri]
Thank you very much for this fantastic talk. I'm sure we have lots of questions so while people get typing maybe I should start with one from me. What I found quite interesting was how you showed that a lot of things we consider as obvious may not be, were actually quite counterintuitive. When we talk about sea level drops we often think about these land bridges between islands and the mainland but what these land bridges really were and what they could have been like seems to be kind of ambiguous. Low-lying, swampy, maybe not very nice places to live and in fact we don't see perhaps all the faunal turnovers we might expect when Mediterranean islands supposedly connect to the mainland. I wondered if you had any comments about this? 

[Matteo Vacchi]
Yes, of course I have lots of comments because this is a personal crusade let's say. I really don't like the simplicistic approach to the paleo-landscape reconstruction because most of the paleo-landscape reconstruction which are used right now are based on the present topography or bathymetry, especially the bathymetry. This is very complex because as we see from several areas not only in the Mediterranean the geometry of the coast at least in the last six seven thousand years changed a lot especially in the big coastal plains or whatever. So of course the results of the present-day topography is a result of erosion and deposition and we cannot subdivide in a very clear way the two components. So maybe a land bridge that is now present is the result of a big deposition of, I don't know a big coastal plain, that was not present during the population of some prehistoric men or whatever. So the only way of course for the last six seven thousand years this is relatively simpler because we have the big coastal plains we can core there and we can reconstruct this kind of paleo-landscape. Of course if we go earlier it's much more complex because we need to core underwater and of course you probably know that it's not very easy from several points of view. First of all because it's very expensive, very very expensive. For instance now together with my colleagues Marta Pappalardo here in Pisa we had a very very well paid grant to investigate the area that is at the border between France and Italy. It's called the Balzi Rossi area. It's one of the most important prehistorical archaeological site of the northern Mediterranean and we have lots of money and we are waiting now two years for the permission for the cores underwater. So this is also very complex. Of course if you have the cores and at the moment I know there are very beautiful corses for instance in the northern Adriatic made by several schools that are working there. Of course you can reconstruct from the cores the paleo-landscape so you can reconstruct the age of a particular lagoon that was there or another colleague of mine Alessandro Fontana did a very beautiful cores in the northern Adriatic sea and they reconstruct also the tidal system that was a sort of paleo-Venice lagoon of the prehistoric period. So I cannot say that there is an easy way to reconstruct this but I think that a paleo-landscape reconstruction which is based only to the present-day topography or bathymetry, of course now no one is using the present-day topography to reconstruct the paleo-landscape, but lots of people reconstruct the paleo-landscape from the bathymetric data. Of course we have this bathymetric data, they are very interesting. In many cases probably they reflect quite well the paleo-landscape but we don't know the type of accuracy we can obtain from this. For instance now we have found really recently thanks to very beautiful bathymetry that were done in the Bonifacio Strait, so between Sardinia and Corsica, a couple of very beautiful paleo-shorelines that reflect a shoreline geometry which is totally different from the present one and also from the one that is indicated by the present-day bathymetry. So we have a totally different orientation of the coast. This is just one example, I don't know because I know that it's not very easy to confirm or not confirm this kind of reconstruction, but this is a key point I think for the future investigation. 

[Eleanor Scerri]
Thank you. We have another question from Mario. Thanks a lot for such an amazing talk. You mentioned that during the last 4,000 years the rising of the Mediterranean sea level has been relatively stable. We also know that the Mediterranean basin is relatively active from a tectonic perspective. So could tectonics be one of the main factors that would have contributed to this stabilisation? 

[Matteo Vacchi]
No, the tectonic is not contributing to the stabilisation but is modifying a lot this stabilisation. For instance in Naples, in the area of Naples in the Phlegraean Fields, the tectonics was the main driver of the relative sea level evolution. So we have now, also in Naples as I showed you, the sea level that is much lower, for instance the Roman sea level that is much lower than the Roman sea level we can find in other tectonically stable areas of the Mediterranean. So in order to answer in a more complete way to this question, in tectonically stable area of the Mediterranean the relative sea level change in the last 4,000 years was minimal. Especially in the last 2,000 years the most updated data say that this change did not exceed 90 centimetres or 80 centimetres. Of course in many areas of the Mediterranean we can find the sea level very puzzling because of the tectonics. Because of course the tectonics is moving the land up or down and so the relative sea level can change a lot. I hope I have answered the question. 

[Eleanor Scerri]
Thank you. I think we have there's okay there's a few more questions. We'll have to move quite quickly though because we're almost out of time. From Suzanne, thank you for this interesting presentation. I might have skipped it but did you see a change in salinity depending on the sea level? Did this also result in changes in marine species such as shells or corals to name but a few? 

[Matteo Vacchi]
Yes, well the change in salinity of the Mediterranean it's oh sorry the change in the salinity I'm not very expert on the change in the salinity of the Mediterranean especially after the last glacial maximum. What I can say is that for instance during the last interglacial, so as I said at the beginning the last period where the sea level was higher than today we had and also the climate the general climate of the Mediterranean was warmer than today. We have the in the fossil records we have species that are now typical of Morocco or Senegal and wherever. So they entered in the Mediterranean during a warmer period. Another point that is interesting for the last six seven thousand years is that of course the relative sea level stabilization that I showed you in the last eight seven thousand years of course promoted the activation of the coastal progradation. So the input of the river was much more important than the sea level rise and this promoted also the formation of the big lagoons and so also in terms of I don't know I'm just proposing this because we don't have data on this topic but for instance in terms of exploitation of the marine fauna from the prehistoric period of course the formation of big lagoons maybe would have favored the fishing of typical lagoon species instead of typical marine species that were more abundant before. But I don't know this is just I'm not very expert on this field. 

[Eleanor Scerri]
Okay so another super quick questions. Yau can we know about paleoanthropological data and evolutionary interactions in the using of natural resources and space occupation? Okay this is a bit late for that. 

[Matteo Vacchi]
Yeah this is what I'd like to do in the future I mean because now I have a quite clear picture of how the Mediterranean evolved in and also how the coastal area responded in terms of changing vegetation and whatever to this major change of the sea level and what I'd like to investigate is the response of the coastal community to these changes. But this is a bit something that I'd like to do in the future it's not very easy but it's something that is very interesting for me because now we have a lot of data at least for the Mediterranean we have really a huge amount of data. 

[Eleanor Scerri]
Super interesting and the last question from Andres thanks for your talk Matteo I was wondering about paleo shorelines and if they preserve well from pre-Holocene chronologies can we only identify present-day submerged paleo shorelines by coring? 

[Matteo Vacchi]
Okay first of all ciao Andres nice to hear from you. It's complex to find something that is pre-Holocene because they are very deep in general this data and at the moment in my database of the Mediterranean area there are very few radiocarbon dated paleo shorelines from the pre-Holocene period. However we can reconstruct this from seismic lines so maybe we don't know exactly where it was the paleo sea level but we can find evidence of beaches in the seismic layer. The other big problem is that most of the pre-Holocene data are based on geophysical models so we have geophysical models that indicate us where it was the paleo sea level at certain period so from zero down to the last glacial maximum but and this is why I'm working a lot with the geophysical models. This model is quite accurate up to 8 000 years ago but then when we went in earlier periods we have a misfit between data and models so I'm not sure that the models can be totally let's say good for the reconstruction of the paleo sea level. We need to extract more data from deeper cores but as I said at the beginning of the questions it's not very easy to obtain authorization and money for a deep cores and second point we need to find very beautiful layers of low energy environment in these cores because typically in these cores you have marine sediments and marine sediments and marine sediments and marine sediments and these are not very useful for sea level reconstruction. In some way, sometimes like in the northern Adriatic for instance but also in front of the Ebro delta if I'm well and also in front of the Rhône delta in France they found layers of lagunar sediments or salt marsh sediments and this can be very useful for the reconstruction of the paleo sea level. 

[Eleanor Scerri]
Thank you very much I think that's all we have time for today so thanks this has been such a great talk so interesting I can tell people still have questions but we have to cut it short so maybe if you have any burning questions you can write to Matteo I'm sure like we will be in touch ourselves at some point with some questions about the shoreline change in the Mediterranean past. Thank you everybody for coming and we'll see you next time. Okay thank you so much for this invitation it was a pleasure for me. Thank you. Bye bye.
