# Video transcription

This section contains files related to videos that are publicly available.

Each transcription will have its own folder.

The folder names are structured as follows:

`<year>_<author>_<cleaned title>` (reference name)

Each folder contains a 

* bibtex file (`<reference name>`.bib) with the relevant meta-data and a 
* text file (`<reference name>`.transcription.txt) with the transcription.

Transcriptions are curated, i.e. the Speech-to-Text transcription errors are corrected.
However it cannot be excluded that some errors are still present.

Some files will have speaker annotations in square brackets.


The initial transcription is made by [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper).
