; in case the measured line was grid-relative only (meridian convergence issue) or had other problems, allow a corrective rotation also here.
; Unfortunately, a horizon with edges at exactly 0 or 180 degrees azimuth causes bad effects. Adding a minimal offset avoids this without causing much trouble.
; Because we can mix photo and polygon in the other classes, use a different name for the polygon rotation:
;polygonal_angle_rotatez=0.00001
polygonal_angle_rotatez=0

; Fill color for this landscape. It gets darkened at night
ground_color = .15,.45,.45
; Color for the line. It will not be drawn if this is not defined. This color will not be dimmed at night.
horizon_line_color =  .25,.15,.15
; specify a minimum brightness value 0..1 to have the ground always visible.
